# Kinetic CSS Loader

https://thedanitor.github.io/kinetic_css_loader/

This project is from the Day 23 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.

### Overall Impression

The more exposure I get to @keyframes the more I realize that animating elements is not that difficult. This loader was easy to make and has given me some ideas for making loading screens of my own. 

### Things Learned

* Can make a triangle in CSS by making an element height/width 0, adding a border, and then giving one edge of the border a different color.
