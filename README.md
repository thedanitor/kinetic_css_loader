# Kinetic CSS Loader

https://thedanitor.github.io/kinetic_css_loader/

This project is from the Day 23 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.
